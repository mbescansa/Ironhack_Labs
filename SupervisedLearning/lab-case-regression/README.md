# Lab | Final regression model in "Health Care for All" Case

### Instructions

At this point, we have created a model to predict who will make a donation and who won't. But, what about the ammount of money that each person will give?
In this lab, subset those that made a donation and use that subset to create a model to predict how much money will they give.

Evaluate the result of your model and estimate how much better the result are for the bussiness in comparison with the naive scenario we discuss on Monday.
